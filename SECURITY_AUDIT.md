# Security Audit - Simple Token Contract

## Security Issues Found

### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. **Tax Distribution Rounding Error**
   - **Location**: `_distributeTax()` function (lines 121-123)
   - **Issue**: Due to integer division, small amounts can be lost in rounding
   - **Impact**: Minor token loss, but should be fixed
   - **Fix**: Ensure treasury gets remainder after liquidity + marketing

2. **ReentrancyGuard Not Applied**
   - **Location**: Transfer functions
   - **Issue**: ReentrancyGuard is imported but not used on transfer functions
   - **Impact**: Low (ERC20 transfers are generally safe), but best practice to add
   - **Fix**: Add nonReentrant modifier to transfer functions

### 🟡 Medium Issues

3. **Centralization Risks**
   - **Location**: Multiple owner functions
   - **Issue**: Owner has too much power:
     - Can change tax rates (up to 5%)
     - Can change wallet addresses
     - Can exempt any address from taxes
     - Can withdraw entire treasury
   - **Impact**: Trust required in owner
   - **Fix**: Consider timelock, multi-sig, or renounce ownership

4. **No Tax Distribution Validation**
   - **Location**: `_distributeTax()` function
   - **Issue**: No check that percentages sum to 100%
   - **Impact**: Could lead to incorrect distribution
   - **Fix**: Add validation or use constants

5. **Buyback Front-Running**
   - **Location**: `_buybackAndBurn()` function
   - **Issue**: Buyback can be front-run by MEV bots
   - **Impact**: Minor, but reduces effectiveness
   - **Fix**: Consider random delays or other mechanisms

### 🟢 Low Issues / Best Practices

6. **Missing Events**
   - Some state changes don't emit events
   - **Fix**: Add events for all state changes

7. **No Pause Mechanism**
   - No emergency pause function
   - **Fix**: Add pause functionality (optional)

8. **No Maximum Treasury Limit**
   - Treasury can grow indefinitely
   - **Fix**: Add maximum treasury cap (optional)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Before Mainnet)
1. ✅ Fix tax distribution rounding
2. ✅ Add tax distribution validation
3. ✅ Add ReentrancyGuard to transfers (best practice)

### Before Professional Audit
1. Consider timelock for critical functions
2. Consider multi-sig wallet
3. Add comprehensive events
4. Consider pause mechanism

### Long-term Improvements
1. Renounce ownership (if possible)
2. Implement DAO governance
3. Add maximum treasury cap
4. Consider buyback randomization
