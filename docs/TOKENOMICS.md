# Tokenomics - Bird Token

## Overview

Bird Token is designed with sustainable tokenomics that create value for holders while generating revenue for project development and marketing.

## Token Supply

**Total Supply**: 10,000,000 BIRD tokens

This supply was chosen for:
- Psychological appeal (higher per-token price)
- Good balance of scarcity and usability
- Can burn more later to increase value

## Distribution

### How Tokens Are Actually Distributed

**On Deployment:**
- **100% of tokens (10,000,000 BIRD) are minted to the owner**
- The contract does NOT automatically distribute tokens
- Owner receives all tokens and must distribute them manually

### Recommended Distribution Plan

After deployment, the owner should distribute tokens according to this plan:

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Treasury | 30% | 3,000,000 | For buyback/burn mechanism (stays in contract treasury) |
| Public Sale | 50% | 5,000,000 | Fair launch distribution to community |
| Liquidity | 20% | 2,000,000 | Initial DEX liquidity (should be locked) |

**Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ **This is a RECOMMENDED plan, not automatic**
- ⚠️ **Owner must manually transfer tokens after deployment**
- ⚠️ **No automatic vesting or locking in the contract**
- ⚠️ **Owner controls all tokens until distributed**
- ✅ **For transparency, owner should distribute as planned**
- ✅ **Liquidity should be locked using a locking service**

## Transaction Tax

**Tax Rate**: 3% (300 basis points)

Applied to all buys and sells, except:
- DEX pair addresses (exempt)
- Owner and contract addresses (exempt)
- Other exempt addresses set by owner

### Tax Distribution

| Destination | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Liquidity Pool | 40% | Auto-adds to liquidity, supports price |
| Marketing Wallet | 30% | Marketing campaigns, partnerships |
| Treasury | 30% | Accumulates for buyback and burn |

## Buyback & Burn Mechanism

### How It Works

1. **Treasury Accumulation**: 30% of transaction taxes go to treasury
2. **Threshold**: When treasury reaches 100,000 tokens
3. **Automatic Buyback**: Tokens are automatically burned
4. **Deflationary Effect**: Reduces supply, supports price

### Benefits

- **Deflationary**: Supply decreases over time
- **Price Support**: Buyback creates buying pressure
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention needed
- **Transparent**: All burns are on-chain

## Revenue Streams

- **Frequency**: Every transaction
- **Sustainability**: Scales with volume

### 2. Treasury Accumulation

### 3. Future Revenue (Optional)
