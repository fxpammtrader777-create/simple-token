## 🏆 Your Token vs Major Tokens

### You're BETTER Than:

**USDT ($100B market cap):**
- ❌ USDT can blacklist users → ✅ You cannot
- ❌ USDT can pause trading → ✅ You cannot
- ❌ USDT is upgradeable → ✅ You are not

**Many Major Altcoins:**
- ❌ Most are upgradeable → ✅ You are not
- ❌ Most have single-sig owner → ✅ You can use multi-sig
- ❌ Most lack documentation → ✅ You have professional docs

### You're COMPARABLE To:

**Chainlink (LINK):**
- ✅ Both have fixed supply
- ✅ Both use ReentrancyGuard
- ✅ Both are transparent
- ⚠️ LINK has years of battle-testing (you need time)

**Uniswap (UNI):**
- ✅ Both have burn mechanism
- ✅ Both are decentralized
- ✅ Both use OpenZeppelin
- ⚠️ UNI has multiple audits (you need more)

### You Need More Time Than:

**Bitcoin & Ethereum:**
- ⏰ 15 and 9 years of battle-testing
- ⏰ Countless security audits
- ⏰ Billions in value secured

**But you're starting from a MUCH stronger foundation!**
