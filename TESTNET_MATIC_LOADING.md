# Testnet MATIC Loading - What to Expect

## ⏳ What's Happening

**Testnet MATIC is being sent to your wallet!**

This usually takes:
- **10-30 seconds** (most common)
- **Up to 5 minutes** (if faucet is busy)
- **Sometimes longer** (during high traffic)

---

## ✅ How to Check

### In MetaMask:
1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Make sure you're on **"Mumbai Testnet"** network
3. Check your balance (should show MATIC amount)
4. Refresh if needed (click account, then back)

### On Polygonscan:
1. Go to: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Check "Balance" - should show MATIC

---

## 🎯 What You Need

**For deployment, you need**:
- **~0.1 MATIC** (minimum)
- Faucet usually gives **0.1-0.5 MATIC**
- Enough for multiple deployments

---

## ⏰ While Waiting

**You can**:
1. ✅ Make sure MetaMask is on Mumbai Testnet
2. ✅ Double-check your wallet address
3. ✅ Prepare your `.env` file (add private key)
4. ✅ Review deployment steps

**Don't worry if it takes a few minutes** - faucets can be slow during busy times.

## 🔄 If It Doesn't Arrive

### Wait First:
- Give it **5-10 minutes**
- Faucets can be slow

### Then Try:
1. **Refresh MetaMask** (switch networks, then back)
2. **Try different faucet**:
   - https://mumbaifaucet.com/
   - https://faucet.quicknode.com/polygon/mumbai
3. **Check Polygonscan** - see if transaction is pending
4. **Try again** - sometimes faucets need retry

---

## ✅ Once You Have MATIC

**You'll see in MetaMask**:
- Balance shows MATIC amount (e.g., 0.1 MATIC)
- Network shows "Mumbai Testnet"

**Then you can**:
1. ✅ Add private key to `.env`
2. ✅ Run `npm run deploy:testnet`
3. ✅ Deploy your Bird token!

## 📋 Next Steps Checklist

While waiting for MATIC:
- [ ] MetaMask on Mumbai Testnet
- [ ] Private key ready (from MetaMask)
- [ ] Private key added to `.env` file
- [ ] Testnet MATIC received (waiting...)
- [ ] Ready to deploy!

---

## 🎯 Quick Check

**To verify MATIC arrived**:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Check network = "Mumbai Testnet"
3. Check balance > 0 MATIC

**If balance shows MATIC**: ✅ Ready to deploy!

**If balance is 0**: ⏳ Still loading, wait a bit longer

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Make sure you're on Mumbai network** - MATIC won't show on other networks
2. **Check transaction on Polygonscan** - see if it's pending
3. **Be patient** - faucets can be slow
4. **Try different faucet** - if one doesn't work

**Once you have testnet MATIC, you're ready to deploy!** 🚀

Let me know when it arrives and we can proceed with deployment!
