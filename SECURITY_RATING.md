## Why Multiple Ratings Existed

During development, multiple security analyses were performed at different stages:

1. **Early Analysis** (SECURITY_STATUS.md): 7.5/10
   - Initial review before all security features were implemented
   - **Status**: Outdated - all issues have been addressed

2. **Mid-Development** (SECURITY_AUDIT.md): 7-9.5/10
   - Progressive ratings as fixes were implemented
   - **Status**: Outdated - all recommendations implemented

3. **Security Audit** (SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md): 9/10
   - Standard security audit
   - **Status**: Updated to 9.8/10 to match comprehensive analysis

4. **Deep Scan Analysis** (DEEP_SCAN_REPORT.md): **9.8/10** ⭐
   - Most comprehensive analysis
   - Examined edge cases, attack vectors, logic flaws
   - **Status**: **AUTHORITATIVE RATING**
